Hi there :)

My name is <b>Cristian Marquez Russo</b> and I began to love tech when I was around 14 years old. I was building batch scripts and programs on QBasic back then.

I ran my own "startup" fixing computers and building internet cafes years after. I implemented "automation scripts"  using Norton Ghost and Deep Freeze.

Soon after I discovered Linux and I started playing with it. My first distro was Connectiva, but I continued exploring others: Debian, Slackware and Ututo, a distro from Salta, my City. Mount was manual and you needed to compile the kernel from time to time. _I learn lots thanks to the OpenSource community!_

My career continued in CÃ³rdoba - Argentina, where I gained more experience on Software Development, Cloud and DevOps while working for top IT companies. 

I flew to New Zealand in 2015 for "holidays" and it's the place that I call home now.

On this blog you will find info about technology and my trips.
